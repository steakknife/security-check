## Background

The iMAS security-check security control offers a continuous jailbreak detect and debug attach checking.  With this information, one can programatically decide to shutdown the app or other loss prevention techniques.  The security control makes system calls at the application level — in particular, ptrace and getpid.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed
1. Debugger tool use
   - CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel

## Installation

* Add security-check repository as a submodule to your project 
  * `git submodule add git@github.com:project-imas/security-check.git vendor/security-check`
* Drag SecurityCheck.xcodeproj into the your project as a subproject
* Add SecurityCheck Framework to target’s build phase - target dependancies (use +)
* Add libSecurityCheck.a to targets's build phase - link binary with libraries
* include `#import <SecurityCheck/SecurityCheck.h>` in your code at the app delegate level to start

## Installation via CocoaPod

* If you don't already have CocoaPods installed, do `$ sudo gem install cocoapods` in your terminal. (See the [CocoaPods website](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started) for details.)
* In your project directory, do `pod init` to create a Podfile.
* Add `pod 'SecurityCheck', :git => 'https://github.com/project-imas/security-check.git'` to your Podfile
* Run `pod install`
* Include `#import <SecurityCheck/SecurityCheck.h>` in your code at the app delegate level to start

## Usage

Place the following code at the app delegate level and call it early to detect security problems before the core code runs.

```
    //-----------------------------------
    // call back to weHaveAProblem
    //-----------------------------------
    cbBlock chkCallback  = ^{
        

        __weak id weakSelf = self;
        
        if (weakSelf) [weakSelf weHaveAProblem];
    };

    //-----------------------------------
    // jailbreak detection
    //-----------------------------------
    checkFork(chkCallback);
    checkFiles(chkCallback);
    checkLinks(chkCallback);
    
    dbgStop;
    dbgCheck(chkCallback);
    
    ...
    
    //** Note: Rename this function in your code
- (void) weHaveAProblem {
    
    NSLog(@"weHaveAProblem in AppDelegate");
    
        //** cause segfault
    //int *foo = (int*)-1; // make a bad pointer
    //printf("%d\n", *foo);       // causes segfault
    
    //** OR launch blank, black colored window that hangs the user
    SViewController *sc = [[SViewController alloc] init];
    _window.rootViewController = sc;
    [_window makeKeyAndVisible];

#if 1
    //** OR re-launch the splash screen, must be preceded by SViewController as that controller overwrites the rootcontroller
    //** which changes the app flow
    UIImageView *myImageView =[[UIImageView alloc]
                               initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0,0.0,self.window.frame.size.width,self.window.frame.size.height)];
    
    myImageView.image=[UIImage imageNamed:@"Default.png"];
    myImageView.tag=22;
    [self.window addSubview:myImageView ];
    [myImageView release];
    [self.window bringSubviewToFront:myImageView];
#endif
    
    //** OR make this thread stop and spin
    //volatile int dummy_side_effect;
    //
    //while (1) {  dummy_side_effect = 0; }
    //NSLog(@"Never prints.");


    //** recommend not EXITing as foresics can easily find exit(0) and replace with NOP
    //exit(0);
}

 ```
